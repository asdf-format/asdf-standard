  Top-level schema for every ASDF file.

description: |
  This schema contains the top-level attributes for every ASDF file.

type: object
properties:
  asdf_library:
    description: |
      Describes the ASDF library that produced the file.
    $ref: "software-1.0.0"

  history:
    description: |
      A log of transformations that have happened to the file.  May
      include such things as data collection, data calibration
      pipelines, data analysis etc.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: "history_entry-1.0.0"

  data:
    description: |
      The data array corresponds to the main science data array in the
      file.  Oftentimes, the data model will be much more complex than
      a single array, but this array will be used by applications that
      just want to convert to a display an image or preview of the
      file.  It is recommended, but not required, that it is a
      2-dimensional image array.
    $ref: "ndarray-1.0.0"

  fits:
    description: |
      A way to specify exactly how this ASDF file should be converted
      to FITS.
    $ref: "../fits/fits-1.0.0"

  wcs:
    description: |
      The location of the main WCS for the main data.
