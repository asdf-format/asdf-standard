title: |
  Colles' conic perspecitve projection.

description: |
  Corresponds to the `COP` projection in the FITS WCS standard.

  See
  [conic](ref:http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/transform/conic-1.0.0)
  for the definition of the full transformation.

  The transformation is defined as:

  $$C &= \sin \theta_a \\
    R_\theta &= \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \cos \eta [ \cot \theta_a - \tan(\theta - \theta_a)] \\
    Y_0 &= \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \cos \eta \cot \theta_a$$

  Invertibility: All ASDF tools are required to provide the inverse of
  this transform.
