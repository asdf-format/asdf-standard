ASDF Schemas
============

ASDF uses `JSON Schema`_ to perform validation of ASDF files. Schema validation
of ASDF files serves the following purposes:

* Ensures conformity with core data types defined by the ASDF Standard. ASDF
  readers can detect whether an ASDF file has been modified in a way that would
  render it unreadable or unrecognizable.
* Enables interoperability between ASDF implementations. Implementations that
  recognize the same schema definitions should be able to interpret files
  containing instances of data types that conform to those schemas.
* Allows for the definition of custom data types. External software packages
  can provide ASDF schemas that correspond to types provided by that package,
  and then serialize instances of those types in a way that is standardized
  and portable.

All ASDF implementations must implement the types defined by the `core schemas
<core-schema>` and validate against them when reading files. [#]_ The ASDF
Standard also defines several other categories of schemas, which are optional
for ASDF implementations:

* :ref:`unit <unit-schema>`
* :ref:`time <time-schema>`
* :ref:`transform <transform-schema>`
* :ref:`World Coordinate System (WCS) <wcs-schema>` (primarily intended for
  astronomical applications)

.. Fits is deliberately omitted from this list.

The ASDF Standard also defines two metaschemas which are used to validate the
ASDF schemas themselves:

* :ref:`yaml-schema`
* :ref:`ASDF Schema <asdf-schema-1.0.0>`

More information on the schemas defined by ASDF can be found in :ref:`schema`.

Schema Implementation
---------------------

ASDF schemas are encoded in YAML and conform to a superset of `JSON Schema`_
called :ref:`yaml-schema`. The version of YAML supported by ASDF is 1.1.
Accordingly, all schemas begin with the following YAML header::

  %YAML 1.1
  ---

The following top-level attributes are required for all ASDF schemas: [#]_

* ``$schema``: Indicates the metaschema definition used to validate this schema
* ``id``: A name that uniquely identifies the schema
* ``tag``: The YAML tag corresponding to the type described by this schema

Each of these attributes is described in more detail below.

$schema
^^^^^^^

ASDF schemas use the top-level ``$schema`` attribute to declare the metaschema
that is used to validate the schema itself. Most custom ASDF schemas will
conform to :ref:`YAML Schema <yaml-schema>` defined by the ASDF Standard, and
so will have the following top-level attribute::

   $schema: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/yaml-schema/draft-01"

Some ASDF schemas use the :ref:`ASDF metaschema <asdf-schema-1.0.0>` instead
(e.g. `ndarray <core/ndarray-1.0.0>`).  It is also possible to create custom
metaschemas, although these should always inherit from either YAML Schema or
the ASDF metaschema. [#]_

Some ASDF implementations may choose to validate the schemas themselves (e.g.
as part of a regression testing suite). The ``$schema`` keyword should be used
to determine the metaschema to be used for validation. All schemas should also
validate successfully against :ref:`yaml-schema`.

id
^^

The ``id`` represents the globally unique name of the schema. It must be a
`valid URI <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ and cannot be an empty
string or an empty fragment (e.g. ``#``).  See `naming-conventions` for
conventions to ensure global uniqueness.

While the ``id`` must be a valid URI, it does not have to describe a real
location on disk or on a network. For example, the ``id`` values for all
schemas in the ASDF Standard begin with the prefix
``http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/``.  However, as of this writing, none of the
schemas are actually hosted at that location.

The ``id`` keyword is used for reference resolution both within a schema and
between schemas. Relative references within a schema are resolved against the
``id`` of that schema. A reference to an external schema uses the ``id`` of
that schema. See `schema-references` below for additional information.

Each ASDF implementation must define how to resolve a schema ``id`` to a real
resource that contains the schema itself. This could be done in a variety of
ways, but the following seem like the most likely possibilities:

* Resolve the ``id`` to a real network location (assuming the schema is
  actually hosted at that location)
* Map the ``id`` to a file location on disk that contains the schema

Other mappings are possible in theory. For example, a schema could be stored
in a string literal as part of a program.

tag
^^^

The ``tag`` attribute is used by ASDF to associate an instance of a data type
in an ASDF file with the appropriate schema to be used for validation. It is a
concept from YAML (see the `documentation
<https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#tag/information%20model>`__).

Libraries that provide custom schemas must ensure that the YAML tag that is
written for a particular data type must match the ``tag`` attribute in the
schema that corresponds to the data type. Tags must conform to the tag URI
scheme which is defined in `RFC 4151`_, but are otherwise perfectly arbitrary.
However, certain `naming-conventions` are recommended in order to facilitate a
mapping between ``tag`` and ``id`` attributes.

ASDF implementations must be able to map ``tag`` attributes to the
corresponding schema ``id``. The way that this mapping is defined is up to
individual implementations. However, if the `naming-conventions` are followed,
most implementations will be able to perform prefix matching and replacement.

While the ``id`` attribute will almost certainly become required in a future
version of the ASDF Standard, the ``tag`` attribute may remain optional. This
is because schemas can be referenced by ``id`` without necessarily referring to
a particular tagged type in the YAML representation.

.. _descriptive-info:

Descriptive information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each schema may optionally contain descriptive fields: ``title``,
``description`` and ``examples``.  These fields may contain core markdown
syntax (which will be used for the purposes of rendering schema documentation
by, for example, `sphinx-asdf
<https://github.com/spacetelescope/sphinx-asdf>`__).

- ``title``: A one-line summary of the data type described by the schema

- ``description``: A lengthier prose description of the schema

- ``examples``: A list of example content that conforms to the schema,
  illustrating how to use it.


.. _schema-references:

References
^^^^^^^^^^

A particular ASDF schemas can contain references to other ASDF schemas.
References are encoded by using the ``$ref`` attribute anywhere in the tree.
While `JSON Schema`_ references are purely based on ``id``, ASDF
implementations must be able to resolve references using both ``id`` and
``tag`` attributes.

The resolution of ``id`` or ``tag`` references to actual schema files is up to
individual implementations. It is recommended for ASDF implementations to
use a two-phase mapping: one from ``tag`` to ``id``, and another from ``id`` to
an actual schema resource. In most cases, the ``id`` will be resolved to a
location on disk (e.g. to a schema file that is installed in a known location).
However, other scenarios might involve schemas that are hosted on a network, or
schemas that are embedded in source files as string literals.

.. _naming-conventions:

Naming Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Schema ``id`` attributes must be valid URIs. Schema ``tag`` attributes must be
valid URIs that conform to the tag URI scheme defined in `RFC 4151`_ Aside from
these requirements, assignment of these attributes is perfectly arbitrary.
However, certain conventions are **strongly** recommended in order to ensure
uniqueness and to enable a simple correspondence between the ``id`` and ``tag``
attributes. These conventions are described below.

All schema ids should encode the following information:

* **organization**: Indicates the organization that created the schema
* **standard**: The "standard" this schema belongs to. This will usually
  correspond to the name of the software package that provides this schema.
* **name**: The name of the data type corresponding to this schema.
* **version**: The version of the schema. See `versioning-conventions` for more
  details.

Consider the schemas from the ASDF Standard as an example. In this case, the
**organization** is ``stsci.edu``, which is the web address of the organization
that created the schemas. The **standard** is ``asdf``. Each individual schema
in the ASDF Standard has a different **name** field. In the case of the
:ref:`ndarray <core/ndarray-1.0.0>` data type, for example, the name is
``core/ndarray``. The version of `ndarray <core/ndarray-1.0.0>` is ``1.0.0``.
Some other types in the ASDF Standard have multiple versions, such as
``quantity-1.0.0`` and :ref:`quantity-1.1.0 <unit/quantity-1.1.0>`.

While schema ids can be any valid URI, under this convention they always begin
with ``http://``. The general format of the id attribute becomes::

   http://<organization>/schemas/<standard>/<name>-<version>

Continuing with the example of :ref:`ndarray <core/ndarray-1.0.0>`, we have::

   id: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/core/ndarray-1.0.0"

The idea behind the convention for ``id`` is that it should be possible (in
principle if not in practice) for schemas to be hosted at the corresponding
URL. This motivates the choice of the organization's web address as the
**organization** component. However, this is not a requirement. The primary
objective is to create a globally unique id.

Given the components defined above, the ``tag`` definition follows in a
straightforward manner. The generic tag URI template is::

   tag:<organization>:<standard>/<name>-<version>

Considering `ndarray <core/ndarray-1.0.0>` once again, we have::

   tag: "tag:stsci.edu:asdf/core/ndarray-1.0.0"

Following the naming convention for both ``id`` and ``tag`` attributes enables
a simple mapping from ``tag`` to ``id``. In this case, simply take the prefix
``tag:stsci.edu:`` and replace it with ``http://stsci.edu/schemas/``.

.. _extending-asdf:

Designing a new tag and schema
------------------------------

This section will walk through the development of a new tag and schema. In the
example, suppose we work at the Example Organization, which can be
found on the world wide web at ``example.org``.  We're developing a new
instrument, ``foo``, and we need a way to define the specialized metadata to
describe the exposures that it will be generating.

According to the `naming-conventions`, our ``tag`` and ``id`` attributes will
consist of the following components:

* **organization**: ``example.org``
* **standard**: ``foo``
* **name**: ``metadata``
* **version**: ``1.0.0`` (by convention the starting version for all new schemas)

So, for our example instrument metadata, the tag is::

  tag:example.org:foo/metadata-1.0.0

Each tag should be associated with a schema in order to validate it. Each
schema must also have a universally unique ``id``, which is in the form of
unique URI.

Note that this URI doesn't actually have to resolve to anything.  In fact,
visiting that URL in your web browser is likely to bring up a ``404`` error.
All that's necessary is that it is universally unique and that the tool reading
the ASDF file is able to map from a tag name to a schema URI, and then load the
associated schema.

Again following with our example, we will assign the following URI to refer to
our schema::

  http://example.org/schemas/foo/metadata-1.0.0

Therefore, in our schema file, we have the following keys, one declaring the
name of the YAML ``tag``, and one defining the ``id`` of the schema::

  id: "http://example.org/schemas/foo/metadata-1.0.0"
  tag: "tag:example.org:foo/metadata-1.0.0"


Since our schema is just a basic ASDF schema, we will declare that it conforms
to `yaml-schema` defined by the ASDF Standard::

   $schema: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/yaml-schema/draft-01"

Descriptive information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Continuing our example, we include some `descriptive metadata
<descriptive-info>` about the data type declared by the schema itself::

  title: |
    Metadata for the foo instrument.
  description: |
    This stores some information about an exposure from the foo instrument.
  examples:
    -
      - A minimal description of an exposure.
      - |
          tag:example.org:foo/metadata-1.0.0
            exposure_time: 0.001

The schema proper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rest of the schema describes the acceptable data types and their structure.
The format used for this description comes straight out of JSON Schema, and
rather than documenting all of the things it can do here, please refer to
`Understanding JSON Schema
<http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/>`__, and the
further resources available at `json-schema.org <http://json-schema.org>`__.

In our example, we'll define two metadata elements: the name of the
investigator, and the exposure time, each of which also have a
description::

  type: object
  properties:
    investigator:
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the principal investigator who requested the
        exposure.

    exposure_time:
      type: number
      description: |
        The time of the exposure, in nanoseconds.

We'll also define an optional element for the exposure time unit.
This is a somewhat contrived example to demonstrate how to include
elements in your schema that are based on the custom types defined in
the ASDF standard::

    exposure_time_units:
      $ref: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/unit/unit-1.0.0"
      description: |
        The unit of the exposure time.
      default:
        s

Lastly, we'll declare ``exposure_time`` as being required, and allow
extra elements to be added::

  required: [exposure_time]
  additionalProperties: true

The complete example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is our complete schema example::

  %YAML 1.1
  ---
  $schema: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/yaml-schema/draft-01"
  id: "http://example.org/schemas/foo/metadata-1.0.0"
  tag: "tag:example.org:foo/metadata-1.0.0"

  title: |
    Metadata for the foo instrument.
  description: |
    This stores some information about an exposure from the foo instrument.
  examples:
    -
      - A minimal description of an exposure.
      - |
          tag:example.org:foo/metadata-1.0.0
            exposure_time: 0.001

  type: object
  properties:
    investigator:
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the principal investigator who requested the
        exposure.

    exposure_time:
      type: number
      description: |
        The time of the exposure, in nanoseconds.

    exposure_time_units:
      $ref: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/unit/unit-1.0.0"
      description: |
        The unit of the exposure time.
      default:
        s

  required: [exposure_time]
  additionalProperties: true

.. _extending-a-schema:

Extending an existing schema
----------------------------

`JSON Schema`_ does not support the concept of inheritance, which makes it
somewhat awkward to express type hierarchies. However, it is possible to create
a custom schema that adds attributes to an existing schema (e.g. one defined in
the ASDF Standard). It is important to remember that it is not possible to
override or remove any of the attributes from the existing schema.

The following important caveats apply when extending an existing schema:

* It is not possible to redefine, override, or delete any attributes in the
  original schema.
* It will not be possible to add attributes to any node where the original
  schema declares ``additionalProperties: false``
* Instances of the custom type will not be recognized as an instance of the
  original type when resolving schema references or processing YAML tags (i.e.
  there is no concept of polymorphism).

The best examples for extending an existing schema come from the collection of
`transform schemas <transform-schema>` defined by the ASDF Standard. All
transforms extend the `base transform <transform/transform-1.2.0>`, which is
copied below for reference::

   %YAML 1.1
   ---
   $schema: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/yaml-schema/draft-01"
   id: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/transform/transform-1.2.0"
   title: >
     A generic type used to mark where other transforms are accepted.

   description: >
     These objects are designed to be nested in arbitrary ways to build up
     transformation pipelines out of a number of low-level pieces.

   type: object
   properties:
     name:
       description: |
         A user-friendly name for the transform, to give it extra
         meaning.
       type: string

     inverse:
       description: |
         Explicitly sets the inverse transform of this transform.

         If the transform has a direct analytic inverse, this
         property is usually not necessary, as the ASDF-reading tool
         can provide it automatically.

       $ref: "transform-1.2.0"
   additionalProperties: true

Consider, for example, the `add transform <transform/add-1.2.0>`, which defines
the addition of a list of transforms::

   %YAML 1.1
   ---
   $schema: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/yaml-schema/draft-01"
   id: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/transform/add-1.2.0"
   tag: "tag:stsci.edu:asdf/transform/add-1.2.0"
   title: >
     Perform a list of subtransforms in parallel and then
     add their results together.

   description: |
     Each of the subtransforms must have the same number of inputs and
     outputs.

   examples:
     -
       - A list of transforms, performed in parallel and added together
       - |
         !transform/add-1.2.0
           forward:
             - !transform/generic-1.1.0
               n_inputs: 1
               n_outputs: 2
             - !transform/generic-1.1.0
               n_inputs: 1
               n_outputs: 2

   allOf:
     - $ref: "transform-1.2.0"
     - properties:
         forward:
           type: array
           items:
             $ref: "transform-1.2.0"
       required: [forward]

The crucial portion of this schema definition is the way that the ``allOf``
operator is used to join a reference to the base transform with the definition
of a new attribute called ``forward``. The ``forward`` attribute is defined as
a list of transforms.

The ``allOf`` means that any instance that is validated against ``add`` will
have to conform to both the base transform schema, and the properties specific
to the ``add`` schema.


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] Implementations may expose the control of validation on reading to the
   user (e.g. to disable it on demand). However, validation on reading should
   be the default behavior.
.. [#] The presence of ``id`` and ``tag`` is not currently enforced by the YAML
   Schema but may be in a future version of the ASDF Standard. Authors of new
   schemas should assume that at the very least ``id`` will be required in a
   future version of the Standard.
.. [#] For an example of how to inherit from another metaschema, look at the
   `contents
   <generated/stsci.edu/asdf/asdf-schema-1.0.0.html#Original%20Schema>`__
   of the ASDF metaschema and see how there is a reference to the YAML schema
   in the top-level ``allOf``.
