ASDF Standard Manifests
-----------------------

The ASDF tags (described by schemas) available under each ASDF standard version are all described
by a single manifest document for that ASDF standard version.

.. asdf-autoschemas::
   :schema_root: ../../resources/manifests
   :standard_prefix: asdf-format.org/core

   core-1.0.0
   core-1.1.0
   core-1.2.0
   core-1.3.0
   core-1.4.0
   core-1.5.0
   core-1.6.0

The non-core (astronomy) tags are described separately:

.. asdf-autoschemas::
   :schema_root: ../../resources/manifests
   :standard_prefix: asdf-format.org/astronomy

   astronomy-1.0.0
