title: Arbitrary precision integer value.
description: |
  Represents an arbitrarily large integer value.

examples:
  -
    - An integer value that is stored using an internal array
    - |
        !core/integer-1.0.0
          sign: +
          string: '1193942770599561143856918438330'

    description: |
      An array of unsigned 32-bit words representing the integer value, stored
      as little endian (i.e. the first word of the array represents the least
      significant bits of the integer value).
  sign:
    type: string
    pattern: "^[+-]$"
    description: |
      String indicating whether the integer value is positive or negative.

    type: string
    description: |
      Optional string representation of the integer value. This field is only
      intended to improve readability for humans, and therefore no assumptions
      about format should be made by ASDF readers.
required: [words, sign]
