      The data array corresponds to the main science data array in the
      file.  Oftentimes, the data model will be much more complex than
      a single array, but this array will be used by applications that
      just want to convert to a display an image or preview of the
      file.  It is recommended, but not required, that it is a
      2-dimensional image array.
