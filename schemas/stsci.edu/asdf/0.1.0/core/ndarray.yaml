title: >
  An *n*-dimensional array or table.

description: |
  There are two ways to store the data in an ndarray.

  - Inline in the tree: This is recommended only for small arrays.  In
    this case, the entire ``ndarray`` tag may be a nested list, in
    which case the type of the array is inferred from the content.
    (See the rules for type inference in the ``inline-data``
    definition below.)  The inline data may also be given in the
    ``data`` property, in which case it is possible to explicitly
    specify the ``datatype`` and other properties.

  - External to the tree: The data comes from a [block](ref:block)
    within the same ASDF file or an external ASDF file referenced by a
    URI.

examples:
  -
    - An inline array, with implicit data type
    - |
        !core/ndarray
          [[1, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 1]]

  -
    - An inline array, with an explicit data type
    - |
        !core/ndarray
          datatype: float64
          data:
            [[1, 0, 0],
             [0, 1, 0],
             [0, 0, 1]]

  -
    - An inline table, where the types of each column are
      automatically detected
    - |
        !core/ndarray
          [[M110, 110, 205, And],
           [ M31,  31, 224, And],
           [ M32,  32, 221, And],
           [M103, 103, 581, Cas]]

  -
    - An inline table, where the types of each column are
      explicitly specified
    - |
        !core/ndarray
          datatype: [['ascii', 4], uint16, uint16, ['ascii', 4]]

definitions:
  scalar-datatype:
    description: |
      Describes the type of a single element.

      There is a set of numeric types, each with a single identifier:

      - `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`: Signed integer types, with
        the given bit size.

      - `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`: Unsigned integer types,
        with the given bit size.

      - `float32`: Single-precision floating-point type or "binary32",
        as defined in IEEE 754.

      - `float64`: Double-precision floating-point type or "binary64",
        as defined in IEEE 754.

      - `complex64`: Complex number where the real and imaginary parts
        are each single-precision floating-point ("binary32") numbers,
        as defined in IEEE 754.

      - `complex128`: Complex number where the real and imaginary
        parts are each double-precision floating-point ("binary64")
        numbers, as defined in IEEE 754.

      There are two distinct fixed-length string types, which must
      be indicated with a 2-element array where the first element is an
      identifier for the string type, and the second is a length:

      - `ascii`: A string containing ASCII text (all codepoints <
        128), where each character is 1 byte.

      - `ucs4`: A string containing unicode text in the UCS-4
        encoding, where each character is always 4 bytes long.  Here
        the number of bytes used is 4 times the given length.

  inline-data:
    description: |
      Inline data is stored in YAML format directly in the tree, rather than
      referencing a binary block.  It is made out of nested lists.

      If the datatype of the array is not specified, it is inferred from
      the array contents.  Type inference is supported only for
      homogeneous arrays, not tables.

      - If any of the elements in the array are YAML strings, the
        `datatype` of the entire array is `ucs4`, with the width of
        the largest string in the column, otherwise...

      - If any of the elements in the array are complex numbers, the
        `datatype` of the entire column is `complex128`, otherwise...

      - If any of the types in the column are numbers with a decimal
        point, the `datatype` of the entire column is `float64`,
        otherwise..

      - If any of the types in the column are integers, the `datatype`
        of the entire column is `int64`, otherwise...

      - The `datatype` of the entire column is `bool8`.

      Masked values may be included in the array using `null`.  If an
      explicit mask array is also provided, it takes precedence.

          - If an integer: If positive, the zero-based index of the
            block within the same file. If negative, the index from
            the last block within the same file.  For example, a
            source of `-1` corresponds to the last block in the same
            file.

          - If a string, a URI to an external ASDF file containing the
            block data.  Relative URIs and ``file:`` and ``http:``
            protocols must be supported.  Other protocols may be supported
            by specific library implementations.

          The ability to reference block data in an external ASDF file
          is intentionally limited to the first block in the external
          ASDF file, and is intended only to support the needs of
          [exploded](ref:exploded).  For the more general case of
          referencing data in an external ASDF file, use tree
          [references](ref:references).
