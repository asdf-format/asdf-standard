  A system for describing generalized world coordinate transformations.
description: >
  ASDF WCS is a way of specifying transformations (usually from
  detector space to world coordinate space and back) by using the
  transformations in the `transform-schema` module.

type: object

    description: |
      A list of steps in the forward transformation from detector to
      world coordinates.

      The inverse transformation is determined automatically by
      reversing this list, and inverting each of the individual
      transforms according to the rules described in :ref:`inverse
      <http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/0.1.0/transform/transform/anyOf/0/properties/inverse>`.
