  A system for describing generalized world coordinate transformations.
description: >
  ASDF WCS is a way of specifying transformations (usually from
  detector space to world coordinate space and back) by using the
  transformations in the `transform-schema` module.

    - A complex example where...

      !wcs/wcs
        forward: !wcs/steps
          - !wcs/step
            # Name is the name for the step.  This will allow for an
            # API to say "transform from pixel to focal_plane".  These
            # names are completely arbitrary and do not come from a
            # controlled vocabulary.
            name: pixel

            # Frames is a list of the coordinate frames for each of
            # the axes.  These names come from a controlled vocabulary
            # of standard frame names (see `wcs/frame`), though we
            # should probably also allow custom frame names.
            frames: [detector_y, detector_x, detector_lambda, order]

            # Units are the optional units of the axes.  This is really
            # just for documentation, but could also be used by a unit-aware
            # library to return values with associated units.
            units: [pixel, pixel, nm, null]
