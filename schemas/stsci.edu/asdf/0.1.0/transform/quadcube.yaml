description: |
  Quadrilateralized spherical cube (quad-cube) projections belong to
  the class of polyhedral projections in which the sphere is projected
  onto the surface of an enclosing polyhedron.

  The six faces of the quad-cube projections are numbered and laid out
  as:

  ```
              0
