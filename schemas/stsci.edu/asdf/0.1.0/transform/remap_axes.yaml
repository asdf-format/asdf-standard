  Reorder, add and drop axes.

description: |
  This transform allows the order of the input axes to be shuffled and
  returned as the output axes.

  It is a list made up of integers or "constant markers".  Each item
  in the list corresponds to an output axis.  For each item:

  - If an integer, it is the index of the input axis to send to the
    output axis.

  - If a constant, it must be a single item which is a constant value
    to send to the output axis.

  If only a list is provided, the number of input axes is
  automatically determined from the maximum index in the list.  If an
  object with `mapping` and `n_inputs` properties is provided, the
  number of input axes is explicitly set by the `n_inputs` value.

  Invertibility: TBD
examples:
  -
    - For 2 input axes, swap the axes
    - |
        !transform/remap_axes
          mapping: [1, 0]
  -
    - For 2 input axes, return the second axis and drop the first
    - |
        !transform/remap_axes
          mapping: [1]

  -
    - For 2 input axes, return the first axis twice, followed by the second
    - |
        !transform/remap_axes
          mapping: [0, 0, 1]

  -
    - For 2 input axes, add a third axis which is a constant
    - |
        !transform/remap_axes
          mapping: [0, 1, !core/constant 42]

  -
    - |
        The above example is equivalent to the following, and ASDF
        implementations are free to normalize it thusly:
    - |
        !transform/concatenate
          forward:
            - !transform/remap_axes
              mapping: [0]
            - !transform/remap_axes
              mapping: [1]
            - !transform/constant
              value: 42

  -
    - Here we have 3 input axes, but we are explicitly dropping the last one
    - |
        !transform/remap_axes
          mapping: [0, 1]
          n_inputs: 3
