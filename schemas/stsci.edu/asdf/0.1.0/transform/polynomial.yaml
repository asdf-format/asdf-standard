title: >
  A Polynomial model.

description: |
  A polynomial model represented by its coefficients stored in
  an ndarray of shape $(n+1)$ for univariate polynomials or $(n+1, n+1)$
  for polynomials with 2 variables, where $n$ is the highest total degree
  of the polynomial.

  $$P = \sum_{i, j=0}^{i+j=n}c_{ij} * x^{i} * y^{j}$$

  Invertability: This transform is not automatically invertible.

examples:
  -
    - $P = 1.2 + 0.3 * x + 56.1 * x^{2}$
