  Base class of all conic projections.

description: |
  In conic projections, the sphere is thought to be projected onto the
  surface of a cone which is then opened out.

  In a general sense, the pixel-to-sky transformation is defined as:

  $$\phi &= \arg\left(\frac{Y_0 - y}{R_\theta}, \frac{x}{R_\theta}\right) / C \\
    R_\theta &= \mathrm{sign} \theta_a \sqrt{x^2 + (Y_0 - y)^2}$$

  and the inverse (sky-to-pixel) is defined as:

  $$x &= R_\theta \sin (C \phi) \\
    y &= R_\theta \cos (C \phi) + Y_0$$

  where $C$ is the "constant of the cone":

  $$C = \frac{180^\circ \cos \theta}{\pi R_\theta}$$
