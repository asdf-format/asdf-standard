  Rotation in 3D space.
description: |
  Euler angle rotation around 3 axes.

  Invertibility: All ASDF tools are required to be able to compute the
  analytic inverse of this transform.

examples:
  -
    - The three Euler angles are 12.3, 34 and -1.2 in degrees.

          Sequence of rotation axes: one of `zxz`, `zyz`, `yzy`, `yxy`, `xyx`, `xzx`
          or `native2celestial`, `celestial2native`.

          If `direction` is `native2celestial` or `celestial2native`,
          `phi`, `theta` are the longitude and latitude of the native pole in
          the celestial system and `psi` is the longitude of the celestial pole in
          the native system.

        enum: [zxz, zyz, yzy, yxy, xyx, xzx, native2celestial, celestial2native]
        default: native2celestial

    required: [phi, theta, psi, direction]
