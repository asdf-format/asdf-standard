  ASDF schema
description: |
  A metaschema extending YAML Schema and JSON Schema to add support
  for some ASDF-specific checks, related to nd-arrays.

  - $ref: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/yaml-schema/draft-01"
  - type: object
    properties:
      max_ndim:
        description: |
          Specifies that the corresponding ndarray is at most the
          given number of dimensions.  If the array has fewer
          dimensions, it should be logically treated as if it were
          "broadcast" to the expected dimensions by adding 1's to the
          front of the shape list.
        type: integer
        minimum: 0

      ndim:
        description: |
          Specifies that the matching ndarray is exactly the given
          number of dimensions.
        type: integer
        minimum: 0

      datatype:
        description: |
          Specifies the datatype of the ndarray.

          By default, an array is considered "matching" if the array
          can be cast to the given datatype without data loss.  For
          exact datatype matching, set `exact_datatype` to `true`.

      exact_datatype:
        description: |
          If `true`, the datatype must match exactly.
