title: |
  Conic equidistant projection.

description: |
  Corresponds to the `COD` projection in the FITS WCS standard.

  See
  [conic](ref:transform/conic-1.2.0)
  for the definition of the full transformation.

  The transformation is defined as:

  $$C &= \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \frac{\sin\theta_a\sin\eta}{\eta} \\
    R_\theta &= \theta_a - \theta + \eta\cot\eta\cot\theta_a \\
    Y_0 = \eta\cot\eta\cot\theta_a$$

  Invertibility: All ASDF tools are required to provide the inverse of
  this transform.
