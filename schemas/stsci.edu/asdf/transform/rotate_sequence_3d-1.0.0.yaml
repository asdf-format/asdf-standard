  Rotation in 3D space by arbitrary number of angles about
  arbitrary order of "x", "y", "z" axes.

examples:
  -
    - A sequence of rotation around 5 axes..

      description: |
        A sequence of "x", "y" or "z" characters representing an axis of rotation.
        The number of characters must equal the number of angles.
        For the JWST V23 to sky transform the axes are zyxyz.
