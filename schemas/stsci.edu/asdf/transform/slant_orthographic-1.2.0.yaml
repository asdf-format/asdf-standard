title: |
  The slant orthographic projection.

description: |
  Corresponds to the `SIN` projection in the FITS WCS standard.

  See
  [zenithal](ref:transform/zenithal-1.2.0)
  for the definition of the full transformation.

  The pixel-to-sky transformation is defined as:

  $$\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}R_\theta\right)$$

  And the sky-to-pixel transformation is defined as:

  $$R_\theta = \frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\cos \theta$$

  Invertibility: All ASDF tools are required to provide the inverse of
  this transform.
