title: >
  Set to a constant selected input arguments of a model.

description: |
 This operation takes as the right hand side a dict equivalent
 that consists of key:value pairs where the key identifies 
 the input argument to be set, either by position number
 (0 based) or name, and the value is the floating point value
 that should be assigned to that input. The result is a 
 compound model with n fewer input arguments where n is 
 the number of input values to be set (i.e., the number
 of keys in the dict).
