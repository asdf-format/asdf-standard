title: |
  Base class of all zenithal (or azimuthal) projections.

description: |
  Zenithal projections are completely specified by defining the radius
  as a function of native latitude, $R_\theta$.

  The pixel-to-sky transformation is defined as:

  $$\phi &= \arg(-y, x) \\
  R_\theta &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$

  and the inverse (sky-to-pixel) is defined as:

  $$x &= R_\theta \sin \phi \\
  y &= R_\theta \cos \phi$$
