title: |
  Base class of all pseudocylindrical projections.

description: |
  Pseudocylindrical projections are like cylindrical projections
  except the parallels of latitude are projected at diminishing
  lengths toward the polar regions in order to reduce lateral
  distortion there.  Consequently, the meridians are curved.
