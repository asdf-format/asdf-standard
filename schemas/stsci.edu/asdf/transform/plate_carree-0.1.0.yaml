title: |
  The plate carrée projection.

description: |
  Corresponds to the `CAR` projection in the FITS WCS standard.

  The main virtue of this transformation is its simplicity.

  The pixel-to-sky transformation is defined as:

  $$\phi &= x \\
  \theta &= y$$

  And the sky-to-pixel transformation is defined as:

  $$x &= \phi \\
  y &= \theta$$

  Invertibility: All ASDF tools are required to provide the inverse of
  this transform.
