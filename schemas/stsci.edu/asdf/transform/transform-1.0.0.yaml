title: >
  A generic type used to mark where other transforms are accepted.

description: >
  These objects are designed to be nested in arbitrary ways to build up
  transformation pipelines out of a number of low-level pieces.

type: object
properties:
  name:
    description: |
      A user-friendly name for the transform, to give it extra
      meaning.
    type: string

  domain:
    description: |
      The domain (range of valid inputs) to the transform.
      Each entry in the list corresponds to an input dimension.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: "domain-1.0.0"

  inverse:
    description: |
      Explicitly sets the inverse transform of this transform.

      If the transform has a direct analytic inverse, this
      property is usually not necessary, as the ASDF-reading tool
      can provide it automatically.
