title: >
  An *n*-dimensional homogenous array.
description: >
  The data itself is not stored in the tree, but comes from some other
  source, either a :ref:`block` within the same FINF file, or an external
  file or URI.
examples:
  -
    - A simple double-precision image, in contiguous memory

  -
    - A view of a tile in that image

          shape: [256, 256]
          dtype: float64
          mask: -999

  -
    - An array where another array is used as a mask
    - |
        !ndarray
          source: 0
          shape: [256, 256]

            source: 1
            shape: [256, 256]
            dtype: uint8

  -
    - An array where where the data is stored in the first block in
      another FINF file.

        !ndarray

properties:
  source:
    description: |
      The source of the data.

      - If an integer:
          - If positive, the zero-based index of the block within the
            same file.

          - If negative, the index from the last block within the same
            file.  For example, a source of ``-1`` corresponds to the
            last block in the same file.

      - If a string, a URI to an external FINF file containing the
        block data.  Relative URIs and ``file:`` and ``http:``
        protocols must be supported.  Other protocols may be supported
        by specific library implementations.

        The ability to reference block data in an external FINF file
        is intentionally limited to the first block in the external
        FINF file, and is intended only to support the needs of
        :ref:`exploded`.  For the more general case of referencing
        data in an external FINF file, use tree :ref:`references`.

      - type: integer
      - type: string
        format: uri

  shape:
    description: |
      The shape of the array.

      The first entry may be the string ``*``, indicating that the
      length of the first index of the array will be automatically
      determined from the size of the block.  This is used for
      streaming support.
