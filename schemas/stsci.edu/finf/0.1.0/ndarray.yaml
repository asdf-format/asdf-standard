title: >
  An *n*-dimensional homogenous array.
description: >
  The data itself is not stored in the tree, but comes from some other
  source, either a :ref:`block` within the same FINF file, or an external
  file or URI.
examples:
  -
    - A simple double-precision image, in contiguous memory
    - |
        !ndarray
          source: 0
          shape: [1024, 1024]
          dtype: float64

  -
    - A view of a tile in that image
    - |
        !ndarray
          source: 0
          shape: [256, 256]
          dtype: float64
          strides: [8192, 8]
          offset: 2099200

  -
    - An array in Fortran order
    - |
        !ndarray
          source: 0
          shape: [1024, 1024]
          dtype: float64
          strides: [8192, 8]

  -
    - An array where values of -999 are treated as missing
    - |
        !ndarray
          source: 0
          shape: [256, 256]
          dtype: float64
          mask: -999

  -
    - An array where another array is used as a mask
    - |
        !ndarray
          source: 0
          shape: [256, 256]
          dtype: float64
          mask: !ndarray
            source: 1
            shape: [256, 256]
            dtype: uint8

  -
    - An array where where the data is stored in the first block in
      another FINF file.
    - |
        !ndarray
          source: external.finf
          shape: [256, 256]
          dtype: float64

  -
    - An array where where the data is stored in the second block in
      another FINF file.
    - |
        !ndarray
          source: external.finf#1
          shape: [256, 256]
          dtype: float64

tag: "tag:stsci.edu:finf/0.1.0/ndarray"
type: object
properties:
  source:
    description: |
      The source of the data.

      - If an integer, the zero-based index of the block within the
        same file.

      - If a string, a URI to an external FINF file containing the
        block data.  Relative URIs and ``file:`` and ``http:``
        protocols must be supported.  Other protocols may be supported
        by specific library implementations.

        The ability to reference block data in an external FINF file
        is intentionally limited to the first block in the external
        FINF file, and is intended only to support the needs of
        :ref:`exploded`.  For the more general case of referencing
        data in an external FINF file, use tree :ref:`references`.

    anyOf:
      - type: integer
      - type: string
        format: uri

  shape:
    description: >
      The shape of the array.
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer

  dtype:
    description: >
      The data format of the array elements.

           float64, float128, complex64, complex128, complex256]

  byteorder:
    description: >
      The byte order (big- or little-endian) of the array data.
    type: string
    enum: [big, little]
    default: big

  offset:
    description: >
      The offset, in bytes, within the data for this start of this
      view.
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    default: 0

  strides:
    description: >
      The number of bytes to skip in each dimension.  If not provided,
      the array is assumed by be contiguous and in C order.  If
      provided, must be the same length as the shape property.
    type: array
    items:
      anyOf:
        - type: integer
          minimum: 1
        - type: integer
          maximum: -1

  mask:
    description: >
      Describes how missing values in the array are stored.  If a
      scalar number, that number is used to represent missing values.
      If an ndarray, the given array provides a mask, where non-zero
      values represent missing values in this array.  The mask array
      must be broadcastable to the dimensions of this array.
