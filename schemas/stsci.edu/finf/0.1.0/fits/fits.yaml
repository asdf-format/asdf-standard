title: >
  A standard way to serialize a FITS file inside of a FINF file.
description: |
  This schema is useful for distributing FINF files that can
  automatically converted to FITS files by specifying the exact
  content of the resulting FITS file.

  Not all kinds of data in FITS are directly representable in FINF.
  For example, applying an offset and scale to the data using the
  ``BZERO`` and ``BSCALE`` keywords.  In these cases, the data should
  be converted to a format that FINF does support before storing it in
  a FINF file.  For this reason, it is not possible, or an explicit
  goal, that FITS files can round trip *exactly* through FINF files.
